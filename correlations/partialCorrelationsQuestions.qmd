#### Question 1

What does a variable need to correlate with to be a viable candidate as a covariate?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
viewof partial_correlations_1_response = Inputs.radio(['Both other variables','At least one other variable','No other variables']);
correct_partial_correlations_1 = 'Both other variables';
partial_correlations_1_result = {
  if(partial_correlations_1_response == correct_partial_correlations_1){
    return 'Correct!';
  } else {
    return 'Incorrect or incomplete.';
  };
}
```
**${partial_correlations_1_result}**
