Central tendency describes typical values of a variable, such as its mean and median.

### Mean

The **mean** is often called the "average" informally, but is actually a specific type of "average". The **mean** is the average you get when you add together a group of values, and then divide by the number of items you combined.

## Formula for mean

$$
mean = \frac{total}{N}
$$

$total$ is the total when you add all the items together

$N$ is the number of items you are calculating the mean from

For example, to calculate the mean life expectancy of countries in 2007, we'll use <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/">gapminder data</a>

::: panel-tabset
## R

```{r}
# install (if required) and load the gapminder data
if(!require(gapminder)){install.packages("gapminder")}
library(gapminder)

# create a new data frame that only focuses on data from 2007
gapminder_2007 <- subset(
  gapminder,   # the data set
  year == 2007     
)

# a reminder of the data frame
rmarkdown::paged_table(head(gapminder_2007))                 

# total of all years
sum_life_expectancy  = sum(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)

# count the people
n_life_expectancy    = length(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)        
mean_life_expectancy = sum_life_expectancy/n_life_expectancy 
mean_life_expectancy
```

## Python

```{python}
#| eval: false

# load the gapminder module and import the gapminder dataset
from gapminder import gapminder

# import the tabulate
from tabulate import tabulate

# create a new data frame that only focuses on data from 2007
gapminder_2007 = gapminder.loc[gapminder['year'] == 2007]

#display table
print(tabulate(gapminder_2007[:6], headers=gapminder_2007.head() , tablefmt="fancy_grid",showindex=False ))
```

![](centralTendency-Table1.png){fig-align="left"}

```{python}
#| eval: false

# total of all years
sum_life_expectancy  = gapminder_2007['lifeExp'].sum()

# count the people
n_life_expectancy    = gapminder_2007['lifeExp'].count() 

# calculate mean life expectancy
mean_life_expectancy = sum_life_expectancy/n_life_expectancy 
mean_life_expectancy
```

```         
67.00742253521126
```

## Excel

You should be able to access an excel spreadsheet of the gapminder data [here](gapminder_central.xlsx).

To calculate the mean you can calculate the total of all scores using **sum**, and then divide by the number of items using **count**:

![](images/clipboard-3613706643.png)

Which would give you 59.47443937. However, if you would like to calculate the mean for just the year 2007, you would need to use **sumifs** and **countifs:**

![](images/clipboard-15561174.png)

Which gives us 67.0074225352113.

## JASP

[*You may want to skip to the next section to use the **mean** functionality in JASP*]{.underline}. However, if you would like to calculate the sum and number of data points to manually calculate the mean, use the descriptives functionality and make sure the **Valid** (how many valid data points there are) and **Sum** checkboxes are ticked.

{{< video jaspSumCount.mp4 >}}

You would then divide 101344.445 by 1704 to get 59.47444

If you want the mean for 2007 specifically, you'll need to apply a filter first and then complete the same steps to get the descriptives:

{{< video jaspSumCount2007.mp4 >}}

You would then divide 9515.054 by 142 to get 67.00742
:::

For those of you who like to double check these things (which is a good instinct), let's see what number you get if you use a direct function for mean:

::: panel-tabset
## R

```{r}
mean(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)
```

## Python

```{python}
#| eval: false
gapminder_2007['lifeExp'].mean()
```

```         
67.00742253521126
```

## Excel

We use the **average** function to calculate the mean in Excel:

![](images/clipboard-1161089989.png)

But if we just want the mean of 2007, then we would use the **averageifs** function:

![](images/clipboard-2762730549.png)

Which gives us 67.0074225352113

## JASP

If you want the overall mean in JASP, use the descriptives functionality and make sure the mean is selected:

{{< video jaspMean.mp4 >}}

If you want the mean for 2007 specifically, you'll need to apply a filter first and then complete the same steps to get the descriptives:

{{< video jaspMean2007.mp4 >}}
:::

*Whew* - it's the same as the manual calculation above.

### Median

Now **median** is less known than **mean**. Median is the value in the middle once you sort your data in ascending or descending order. It's well explained in the first paragraph on wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median</a>, so I would suggest looking there. The mean and median are not always the same (in fact, they are usually at least slightly different; remember the mean was 67.00742 when looking at the medians below).

::: panel-tabset
## R

```{r}
median(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)
```

## Python

```{python}
#| eval: false
gapminder_2007['lifeExp'].median()
```

```         
71.93549999999999
```

## Excel

Just use the **median** function:

![](images/clipboard-2983143975.png)

Which should be 60.7125. Or combine **median** and **if** using the following structure:

=median(if(criterion for selecting rows, data you want median from)

![](images/clipboard-911285931.png)

Which should be 71.9355

## JASP

Using the descriptives functionality we can get the median:

{{< video jaspMedian.mp4 >}}

If you want the median for 2007 specifically, you'll need to apply a filter first:

{{< video jaspMedian2007.mp4 >}}
