#### Question 1

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
rand_maths_score = 40 + Math.round(Math.random() * 60);
mean_maths_score = 70
sd_maths_score   = 10
```

Jamie has just completed a mathematics test, where the maximum score is 100%. Their score was \${rand_maths_score}, the mean maths score was \${mean_maths_score} and the SD was \${sd_maths_score}. What is their Z-score?

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
viewof normal_question_1_response = Inputs.number([-7,3], {label: "Z-score", step:.1});
correct_z_score = (rand_maths_score - mean_maths_score)/sd_maths_score;

normal_question_1_result = { 
  if(normal_question_1_response == correct_z_score){
    return "Correct! (" + rand_maths_score + " - " + mean_maths_score + ")/" + sd_maths_score + " = " + correct_z_score;
  } else {
    return "Missing or incorrect. Remember that how Z is calculated by dividing the difference between a value and the mean value by the SD."
  } 
}
```

Your answer is... **\${normal_question_1\_result}**.

#### Question 2

Using the above value, which percentile group would you put Jamie's score into?

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
normal_question_2_correct = {
  if(correct_z_score < -2){
    return "bottom 2.3%";
  } else if(correct_z_score < -1){
    return "bottom 15.9%";
  } else if(correct_z_score < 0){
    return "bottom 50%";
  } else if(correct_z_score < 1){
    return "top 50%";
  } else if(correct_z_score < 2){
    return "top 15.9%";
  } else {
    return "top 2.3%";
  }
}

```

```{ojs}
//| echo: false
viewof normal_question_2_response = Inputs.radio([
  "bottom 2.3%", 
  "bottom 15.9%",
  "bottom 50%",
  "top 50%",
  "top 15.9%",
  "top 2.3%", 
  ], {label: "", value: "A"});
normal_question_2_result = { 
  if(normal_question_2_response == ""){
    return "awaiting your response";
  } else if(normal_question_2_correct == normal_question_2_response){
    return "Correct!";
  } else {
    return "Missing or Incorrect - have a look at the plots above to help you find the correct answer. Note, the distributions are symmetrical, so the pattern for the top half will mirror that for the bottom half.";
  }
}
```

Your answer is... **\${normal_question_2\_result}**.
