    "text": "Mean vs. Median vs. Mode\nThe mean is often called the “average” informally, but is actually a specific type of “average”. The mean is the average you get when add together a group of numbers, and then divide by the number of items you combined.

It’s well explained in the first paragraph on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median, so I would suggest looking there. As you can see below, the mean and median are not always the same (in fact, they are usually at least slightly different):\n\nmean(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 67.00742\n\nmedian(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 71.9355\n\n\n\n\nPython\n\ngapminder_2007['lifeExp'].mean()\n\n67.00742253521126\n\ngapminder_2007['lifeExp'].median()\n\n71.93549999999999\n\n\nFinally, the mode is simply the most frequent number in your data.

    "text": "Variance\n\nPopulation Variance\nVariance is how much the data varies around a mean. To capture this, we compare each individual’s score with the mean, so lets do this with our gapminder data’s life expectancy:\n\nlife_expectancy_variance_table <- data.frame(\n  life_expectancy = gapminder_2007$lifeExp,\n  diff_from_mean  = gapminder_2007$lifeExp - mean(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)\n)\n\nrmarkdown::paged_table(life_expectancy_variance_table)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSo we know for each country how different their life expectacy is to the mean life expectancy. But ideally we would like a single value to summarise variance. Lets see what would happen if we tried to summarise these differences from the mean by calculating the mean difference from the mean:\n\nmean(life_expectancy_variance_table$diff_from_mean) \n\n[1] 5.153937e-15\n\n\nWe get a number that is effectively zero (go here for an explanation about e-numbers), because all the values above the mean balance out those below the mean. So to address this, we can square the differences to force all the numbers to be positive:\n\nlife_expectancy_variance_table$diff_squared = life_expectancy_variance_table$diff_from_mean^2\nrmarkdown::paged_table(life_expectancy_variance_table)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nIf we calculate the average of this, then we get a summary of the variance that is more informative:\n\nmean(life_expectancy_variance_table$diff_squared)\n\n[1] 144.7314\n\n\nHowever, as mean is what you get when you add all the items together and then divide it by the number of items, this can also be done in 2 steps in R (this will help us understand the formula later):\n\nsum_of_squares = sum(life_expectancy_variance_table$diff_squared)\nthis_variance  = sum_of_squares/length(life_expectancy_variance_table$diff_squared)\nthis_variance\n\n[1] 144.7314\n\n\nWe can represent the above in the following formula for the population’s (remember, this is when you have everyone from the group you are measuring) variance:\n\\[\n\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum((x_i- \\bar{x}{} )^2)} {N}\n\\]\nLet’s break down each of the above symbols: σ^2 is population variance Σ is sum xi refers to the value for each participant x̄ refers to the mean for all participants N refers to the number of participants\n(note that the above is written as if we’re looking at the variance of a group of participants, but the principles still work if looking at non-participant data)\n\n\nSample variance\nTo calculate the variance for a sample of participants, rather than every participant in the group you’re measuring, you need a slightly different formula:\n\\[\nS^2 = \\frac{\\sum((x_i- \\bar{x}{} )^2)} {N - 1}\n\\] Note that Sample variance is represented by S^2 rather than σ^2\nSo why do we divide by N-1 rather than N? This is because the sample variance is an estimate rather than the actual population variance. When estimating the population variance you take into account the actual number of people (N) in the sample, whereas when you are estimating what happens generally in the population based on your sample, you take into account the degrees of freedom (N-1). In broad terms this reduces the risk of you under-estimating the variance of the population. You don’t necessarily need to understand degrees of freedom beyond the idea that you are controlling for the fact that you are analysing a sample rather than the population they represent, so don’t worry if the next section isn’t completely clear."

Lets compare the actual population height variance (population_height_variance) to the mean estimate using degrees of freedom that should be used for samples (mean_sample_variance).\n\npopulation_height_variance\n\n[1] 66.66667\n\nmean_sample_variance\n\n[1] 50\n\n\nSo, not perfect, but this is less under-representative of the variance.\nOne thing to bear in mind is that calculation of some statistics does not require use of the degrees of freedom to correct for bias (as seen above, mean was not susceptible to bias).\nIf you would like to understand how degrees of freedom are determined, and what the thinking is behind this term, read on for a brief description of this (otherwise, feel free to skip to the next section).\nDegrees of freedom refers to how many values could change in your variable once you know what the outcome of the relevant statistic is. For example, if you’re interested in the variance of the height of the three people, then you only have 2 degrees of freedom, because once you know the height of 2 of the participants AND the variance of the height, then there the remaining participant only has a 2 possible heights (so their height isn’t free to change)."

    "text": "Often, you can use R as a calculator, for example, if you want to know what two people’s heights are together you can add them:\n\n120 + 130\n\n[1] 250\n\n\nIt’s helpful to store these calculations into objects using <- as shown below:\n\n# this # is starting a comment, code that will be ignored but allows you to annotate your work\nant_height <- 120 # this is exactly the same as writing ant_height = 5 + 2, but <- is encouraged in R to avoid confusion with other uses of = (e.g. == operator when you are comparing if two values are identical)\nbob_height <- 130\nant_height # to show what the value 120 is now stored in the object \"ant_height\"\n\n[1] 120\n\nbob_height # to show what the value 130 is now stored in the object \"bob_height\"\n\n[1] 130\n\n\nThis means that you can compare objects to each other later, e.g. how much taller is Bob than Ant:\n\nbob_height - ant_height\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nSome advice/rules for Objects (sometimes known as variables in other coding languages):\n\nYou cannot have a space in an object name. “my object” would be an invalid object name.\nObject names are case-sensitive, so if your object is called “MyObject” you cannot refer to it as “myobject”.\n“.” and “_” are acceptable characters in variable names.\nYou can overwrite objects in the same way that you define an object, but it arguably will make your code more brittle, so be careful doing so:\n\n\nant_age <- 35 # at timepoint 1\nant_age # to confirm what the age was at this point\n\n[1] 35\n\n# wait a year\nant_age <- 36 # at timepoint 1\nant_age # to confirm that the age has been updated\n\n[1] 36\n\n\n\nYou can’t start an object name with a number\nbe careful to not give an object the same name as a function! This will overwrite the function. To check if the name already exists, you can start typing it and press tab. So typing “t.te” and pressing the tab will give you “t.test”\n\n\nFunctions\nIn a variety of coding languages like R, functions are lines of code you can apply each time you call the function, and apply it to input to get an output. If you wanted to make a function that multiplied numbers by 2, it would look something like:\n\ntimes_two <- function(input){  # Define your function by stating it's name, and then using <- to describe it\n  output = input * 2           # creates an output object that is the input object (see line above) x 2\n  return (output)              # gives the output back to the user when they run the function\n}\ntimes_two(4)                   # should give you 8\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nThe great news is that you don’t need to write functions 99% of the time in R, there are a wide variety of functions that are available. Some of which will be used in the next section.\n\n\nTypes of Objects\n\nVectors\nVectors store a series of values. Often these will be a series of numbers:\n\nheights_vector = c(120,130,135)\nheights_vector\n\n[1] 120 130 135\n\n\nThe “c” above is short for “combine” as you’re combining values together to make this vector. Strings are values that have characters (also known as letters) in them. Lets see if we can make a vector of strings:\n\nnames_vector = c(\"ant\", \"bob\", \"charles\")\nnames_vector\n\n[1] \"ant\"     \"bob\"     \"charles\"\n\n\nLooks like we can. But what happens if you mix strings and numbers in a vector:\n\nyear_group = c(1, \"2a\", \"2b\")\nyear_group\n\n[1] \"1\"  \"2a\" \"2b\"\n\n\nR seems to be happy to put them into a single vector. But there are different types of values and vectors, so lets ask R what each type of (using the “typeof” function) vectors we have above:\n\ntypeof(heights_vector)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(names_vector)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ntypeof(year_group)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThe numeric vector (“heights”) is a “double” vector. Double refers to the fact that the numbers can include decimals, as opposed to integer numbers which have to be whole numbers. Interestingly, R has assumed the list of numbers should be double rather than integer, which seems like the more robust thing to do, as integer numbers can always be double, but double numbers can’t always be integers. Strings are identified as “character” objects, because they are made of characters.\n\n\nData frames\nData frames look like tables, in which you have a series of columns with headers that describe each column.\nSome data frames are already loaded into RStudio when you run it, such as the “mpg” dataframe. To look at it, just type in it’s name (and press CTRL-ENTER on the line, or CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER within the chunk. Note that the below won’t work properly if you write it in the console, you should be running this within an rMarkdown or rNotebook):\n\n# To make a nice looking table in your html output from the \"mpg\" dataframe from the ggplot2 package:\nrmarkdown::paged_table(head(ggplot2::mpg))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNote that you may see 2 tables above, but they should be identical if so\nThe mpg dataframe has information about a variety of cars, their manufacturers, models, as described https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/mpg.html. You will need to refer to data frames and their columns, the convention for this being to write data frame$column. Lets do this to see what’s in the “manufacturer” column:\n\nggplot2::mpg$manufacturer\n\n  [1] \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"      \n  [6] \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"      \n [11] \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"      \n [16] \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\" \n [21] \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\" \n [26] \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\" \n [31] \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\" \n [36] \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [41] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [46] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [51] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [56] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [61] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [66] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [71] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"ford\"      \n [76] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"      \n [81] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"      \n [86] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"      \n [91] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"      \n [96] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"honda\"     \n[101] \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"honda\"     \n[106] \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"   \n[111] \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"   \n[116] \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"   \n[121] \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"      \n[126] \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"      \n[131] \"land rover\" \"land rover\" \"land rover\" \"land rover\" \"lincoln\"   \n[136] \"lincoln\"    \"lincoln\"    \"mercury\"    \"mercury\"    \"mercury\"   \n[141] \"mercury\"    \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"    \n[146] \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"    \n[151] \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"pontiac\"   \n[156] \"pontiac\"    \"pontiac\"    \"pontiac\"    \"pontiac\"    \"subaru\"    \n[161] \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"    \n[166] \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"    \n[171] \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[176] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[181] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[186] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[191] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[196] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[201] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[206] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[211] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[216] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[221] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[226] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[231] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages\nWhilst a lot of the functions you will need are in the base code that is active by default, you will at times need extra packages of code to do more powerful things. A commonly used package is ggplot2 [https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/], which allows you to make beautiful figures in R. To use ggplot2 use need to install it and then load it from the library\n\nif(!require(ggplot2)){install.packages(\"ggplot2\")}\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nNow that you have a package for making beautiful plots, lets learn about “intelligent copy and paste” to make use of it.\n\n\nIntelligent copy and paste\nPeople experienced with coding do not write all their code from memory. They often copy and paste code from the internet and/or from their old scripts. So, assuming you’ve installed and loaded ggplot2 as described above, lets copy and paste code from their website (as of September 2022; https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nGood news is that we have a nice looking figure. But now we need to work out how to understand the code we’ve copied so that you can apply it to your own scripts. There’s a lot to unpack, so making the code more vertical can help you break it down and comment it out. Using the below and a description of the mpg dataframe (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/mpg.html), can you comment it out\n\nggplot(             # R will keep looking at your code until all the open brackets have been closed)\n  mpg,              #\n  aes(              #\n    displ,          #\n    hwy,            #\n    colour = class  #\n  )\n) +                 # R will look to the next line if you end a line with +\ngeom_point()        #\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how I would comment it out:\n\nggplot(\n  mpg,              # dataframe\n  aes(              # aesthetic properties\n    displ,          # x-axis\n    hwy,            # y-axis\n    colour = class  # which column I will base the color on (often \"color\" is safer spelling in code)\n  )\n) + \ngeom_point()        # what I would like drawn on (as opposed to boxplots, lines, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nFormatting code like above to be clearer to read is useful when sharing your scripts with other researchers so that they can understand it!\nNow to understand the above code, try running it after changing lines. For example, what happens if you change the x-axis:\n\nggplot(\n  mpg,              # dataframe\n  aes(              # aesthetic properties\n    cty,            # x-axis - updated\n    hwy,            # y-axis\n    colour = class  # which column I will base the color on (often \"color\" is safer spelling in code)\n  )\n) + \ngeom_point()        # what I would like drawn on (as opposed to boxplots, lines, etc.\n\n\n\n\nTo make beautiful figures in R, you can largely google the type of plot you want, copy the example code that the website has, and then swap in the relevant features for your plot. This principle of copying and pasting code, (making it vertical to make it legible is not necessary, but can be helpful), and then editing it to work for your own script is an essential skill to speed up your coding."

    "text": "type it directly into the console (generally not recommended)\nsave it as a script (better) note that script can refer to any of the below, but in this case is being used to describe a script that doesn’t generate a notebook\nsave it as an R Markdown (better still) - this allows you to make beautiful documents\nsave it as an R Notebook (arguably better than R Markdown) - this allows you to make beautiful documents, and is quicker\n\n\nThe Console\nAt the bottom left of RStudio you should have a console that looks something like what’s highlighted in red below:\n\n\n\nconsole\n\n\nYou can type straight into the console, to get a result. You can scroll through your previous commands by pressing the up arrow in the console. Each time code is run in the console it updates the environment in the top right of R-Studio:\n\n\n\nenvironment\n\n\n\n\nScripts\nThe word “script” can be interpreted specifically, to refer to a type of R file that includes a lot of code, or generally to refer to any file that includes both R code and code that allows you make a nice looking report. In this subsection, we will be focusing on “script” as a particular type of file. To create a script, click on File -> New File -> R Script\n\n\n\nnewScript\n\n\nYou will then be shown a blank script, in which you can write a series of functions, and then run them. To run the lines of code, select a line, and then press CTRL-ENTER, or highlight a chunk of code and then press CTRL-ENTER. In either case, the code will be sent to the console and run there.\nAn advantage of a script over just using the console is that you can analyse your data in both structured and complex ways which is difficult if you are typing code directly into the console.\n\n\nR Markdown\nAs highlighted above, R Markdown is a type of “script” in the general sense of the word, but allows you to create beautiful .html notebooks (.html files are what internet pages are based on). You are in fact reading an example of what can be produced by R Markdown (and R Notebooks). To make an R Markdown file, click on File -> New File -> R Markdown. You will be asked for a title, author and what output you would like. I would suggest “first markdown”, your name and “html” as the respective answers. You should then see something like:\n\n\n\nmarkdown\n\n\nThe following points apply to both R Markdown and R Notebooks\nIf you look above, you may notice that there are 2 types of code: Markdown (to write a nice looking report) and R (in grey chunks). I think these are well explained here: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf so I’ll just explain that R Markdowns run all the code in the chunks each time they generate the output file (e.g. html file). This is important to know, because R Notebooks do not run all the code in all the chunks when you generate them (see below for more on this).\n\n\nR Notebooks\nR Notebooks can be created by clicking on File -> New File -> R Notebook. They look quite similar to R Markdowns, but automatically generate the .html output each time you save the notebook. The output file will be a .nb.html file in the same folder as your notebook.\nVery importantly - the .nb.html file will be built based on what happened the last time you run each R chunk. If you never ran the R Chunk, then the nb.html file will not use the output from that chunk. This makes R Notebooks quicker than R Markdowns, because you don’t have to generate the output from scratch each time, as it will just use whatever was generated the last time the chunk was run. However, this means that there’s a risk your .html output will not be what you expect if you failed to run all of your chunks before saving your file. To address this risk (when you’ve finished editing your file), you can select the “run all” option.\n\n\n\nrunAllChunks"

Height is a good example of a variable within humans, as height changes from person to person.\nWithin coding, a variable tends to refer to a particular object in your code, such as a specific value, list, dataset, etc. In R the terminology for a variable tends to be object.\nWhat is a hypothesis? A(n experimental) hypothesis is a possible outcome for the study you will run.

To give a more concrete example: If the observed difference between two means is small, then there is a high probabilty that this difference could have occured if the null (there is no difference) is true, and so the resulting p-value would also be large. In contrast, if the difference is huge, then this is much less likely to have occured if the null is true, and the subsequent p-value will be smaller to reflect the lower probability."

Within psychology, the alpha value is .05, in which we believe that if the p-value is less than .05 then the result is “significant” (i.e. so unlikely that this would have happened by chance that we conclude this didn’t happen randomly).\nTechnical definition: The alpha-level is the expected rate of false-positives or type 1 errors (in the long run). Under the null hypothesis all p-values are equally probable, and so the value that alpha is sets the chance that a null hypothesis is rejected incorrectly (i.e. we say there is an effect when there isn’t one). Setting alpha at 0.05 is a convention that means we would only do this 5% of the time, and if we wanted to be more or less strict with the this false-positive rate, we could change the value."

Remember that for many statistical tests (parametric) it’s helpful to have data that is normally distributed. Normally distributed data (also known as Gaussian distributions and associated with parametric statistics) generally looks like a bell curve:\nSo we can see when comparing the shape of life expectancies and the shape of a normal distribution that the two aren’t the same.

If we add together the amount of skewness for each data point together and then divide by a general summary of the total standard deviation, then you get an estimate of skewness. The next section is a breakdown of the formula for those interested in it (but this is not crucial), but the key point point is that outliers skew the data, and so outliers that are larger than the mean positively skew the data, and outliers below the mean negatively skew it. If there are an equal number of outliers on either side of the mean then the data will not be skewed.\n\nOptional\nIf we want to manually calculate skewness:\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\mu_{3}} = \\sum((\\frac{x_i- \\bar{x}{}} {\\sigma} )^3) * \\frac{N}{(N-1) * (N-2)}\n\\] To do this in R you could calculate it manually\n\n# applying this to the positive skew data above\npositive_skew_n = length(positive_skew)\npositive_skewness = sum(((positive_skew - mean(positive_skew))/sd(positive_skew))^3) * (\n  positive_skew_n / ((positive_skew_n-1) * (positive_skew_n - 2))\n)\n# to show the output:\npositive_skewness\n\n[1] 0.56013\n\n\n… or just\n\nuse code from https://stackoverflow.com/a/54369572 to give you values for skewness (this has been chosen as this gives skewness and its standard error as calculated by major software like SPSS and JASP):\n\n# Skewness and kurtosis and their standard errors as implement by SPSS\n#\n# Reference: pp 451-452 of\n# http://support.spss.com/ProductsExt/SPSS/Documentation/Manuals/16.0/SPSS 16.0 Algorithms.pdf\n# \n# See also: Suggestion for Using Powerful and Informative Tests of Normality,\n# Ralph B.

To address this, lets use the skewness standard error (see above), to calculate a z-score. Z-scores can capture how significant a value is, i.e. how unlikely the number is considering what you would normally expect. In this case, when you divide skewness by standard error, you get a z-score, and if the absolute value (i.e. ignoring whether it is positive or negative) of the z-score is greater than 1.96 then it is significantly skewed.
