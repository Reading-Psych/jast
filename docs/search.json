    "text": "Mean vs. Median vs. Mode\nThe mean is often called the “average” informally, but is actually a specific type of “average”. The mean is the average you get when add together a group of numbers, and then divide by the number of items you combined. For example, to calculate the mean life expectancy of countries in 2007, we’ll use gapminder data:\n\n# install (if required) and load the gapminder data\nif(!require(gapminder)){install.packages(\"gapminder\")}\n\nLoading required package: gapminder\n\nlibrary(gapminder)\n\n# create a new data frame that only focuses on data from 2007\ngapminder_2007 <- subset(\n  gapminder,   # the data set\n  year == 2007     \n)\n\nrmarkdown::paged_table(head(gapminder_2007))                 # a reminder of the data frame\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nsum_life_expectancy  = sum(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)           # total of all years\nn_life_expectancy    = length(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)        # count the people\nmean_life_expectancy = sum_life_expectancy/n_life_expectancy \nmean_life_expectancy\n\n[1] 67.00742\n\n\nFor those of you who like to double check these things (which is a good instinct), lets see what number you get if you use the r function for mean:\n\nmean(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 67.00742\n\n\nWhew - it’s the same as the manual calculation above.\nNow median is less known than mean, but median is the value in the middle once you order all your data. It’s well explained in the first paragraph on wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median, so I would suggest looking there. As you can see below, the mean and median are not always the same (in fact, they are usually at least slightly different):\n\nmean(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 67.00742\n\nmedian(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 71.9355\n\n\nFinally, the mode is simply the most frequent number in your data. So lets now see if the mode is closer to the mean or median:\n\nmean(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 67.00742\n\nmedian(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 71.9355\n\n# Solution for calculting mode found at https://stackoverflow.com/a/2547918 as there doesn't seem to be a native function:\nlibrary(modeest)\nmlv(gapminder_2007$lifeExp, method = \"mfv\")\n\n  [1] 39.613 42.082 42.384 42.568 42.592 42.731 43.487 43.828 44.741 45.678\n [11] 46.242 46.388 46.462 46.859 48.159 48.303 48.328 49.339 49.580 50.430\n [21] 50.651 50.728 51.542 51.579 52.295 52.517 52.906 52.947 54.110 54.467\n [31] 54.791 55.322 56.007 56.728 56.735 56.867 58.040 58.420 58.556 59.443\n [41] 59.448 59.545 59.723 60.022 60.916 62.069 62.698 63.062 63.785 64.062\n [51] 64.164 64.698 65.152 65.483 65.528 65.554 66.803 67.297 69.819 70.198\n [61] 70.259 70.616 70.650 70.964 71.164 71.338 71.421 71.688 71.752 71.777\n [71] 71.878 71.993 72.235 72.301 72.390 72.396 72.476 72.535 72.567 72.777\n [81] 72.801 72.889 72.899 72.961 73.005 73.338 73.422 73.747 73.923 73.952\n [91] 74.002 74.143 74.241 74.249 74.543 74.663 74.852 74.994 75.320 75.537\n[101] 75.563 75.635 75.640 75.748 76.195 76.384 76.423 76.442 76.486 77.588\n[111] 77.926 78.098 78.242 78.273 78.332 78.400 78.553 78.623 78.746 78.782\n[121] 78.885 79.313 79.406 79.425 79.441 79.483 79.762 79.829 79.972 80.196\n[131] 80.204 80.546 80.653 80.657 80.745 80.884 80.941 81.235 81.701 81.757\n[141] 82.208 82.603\n\n\nThe mode for this data was actually every value perhaps because each value was unique! Lets double check that:\n\nlength(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)\n\n[1] 142\n\nlength(unique(gapminder_2007$lifeExp))\n\n[1] 142\n\n\nThe length of the whole vector and the unique values of the vector is the same, confirming that there’s no repetition in this data (and so no number is the mode). Lets make up some data so that we can look at what the mode is:\n\nmode_example_vector <- c(1,2,2,3,4,4)\nmlv(mode_example_vector, method = \"mfv\")\n\n[1] 2 4\n\n\nIn the above data, there are 2 modes, as the numbers 2 and 4 occur the most."

    "text": "Often, you can use R as a calculator, for example, if you want to know what two people’s heights are together you can add them:\n\n120 + 130\n\n[1] 250\n\n\nIt’s helpful to store these calculations into objects using <- as shown below:\n\n# this # is starting a comment, code that will be ignored but allows you to annotate your work\nant_height <- 120 # this is exactly the same as writing ant_height = 5 + 2, but <- is encouraged in R to avoid confusion with other uses of = (e.g. == operator when you are comparing if two values are identical)\nbob_height <- 130\nant_height # to show what the value 120 is now stored in the object \"ant_height\"\n\n[1] 120\n\nbob_height # to show what the value 130 is now stored in the object \"bob_height\"\n\n[1] 130\n\n\nThis means that you can compare objects to each other later, e.g. how much taller is Bob than Ant:\n\nbob_height - ant_height\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nSome advice/rules for Objects (sometimes known as variables in other coding languages):\n\nYou cannot have a space in an object name. “my object” would be an invalid object name.\nObject names are case-sensitive, so if your object is called “MyObject” you cannot refer to it as “myobject”.\n“.” and “_” are acceptable characters in variable names.\nYou can overwrite objects in the same way that you define an object, but it arguably will make your code more brittle, so be careful doing so:\n\n\nant_age <- 35 # at timepoint 1\nant_age # to confirm what the age was at this point\n\n[1] 35\n\n# wait a year\nant_age <- 36 # at timepoint 1\nant_age # to confirm that the age has been updated\n\n[1] 36\n\n\n\nYou can’t start an object name with a number\nbe careful to not give an object the same name as a function! This will overwrite the function. To check if the name already exists, you can start typing it and press tab. So typing “t.te” and pressing the tab will give you “t.test”\n\n\nFunctions\nIn a variety of coding languages like R, functions are lines of code you can apply each time you call the function, and apply it to input to get an output. If you wanted to make a function that multiplied numbers by 2, it would look something like:\n\ntimes_two <- function(input){  # Define your function by stating it's name, and then using <- to describe it\n  output = input * 2           # creates an output object that is the input object (see line above) x 2\n  return (output)              # gives the output back to the user when they run the function\n}\ntimes_two(4)                   # should give you 8\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nThe great news is that you don’t need to write functions 99% of the time in R, there are a wide variety of functions that are available. Some of which will be used in the next section.\n\n\nTypes of Objects\n\nVectors\nVectors store a series of values. Often these will be a series of numbers:\n\nheights_vector = c(120,130,135)\nheights_vector\n\n[1] 120 130 135\n\n\nThe “c” above is short for “combine” as you’re combining values together to make this vector. Strings are values that have characters (also known as letters) in them. Lets see if we can make a vector of strings:\n\nnames_vector = c(\"ant\", \"bob\", \"charles\")\nnames_vector\n\n[1] \"ant\"     \"bob\"     \"charles\"\n\n\nLooks like we can. But what happens if you mix strings and numbers in a vector:\n\nyear_group = c(1, \"2a\", \"2b\")\nyear_group\n\n[1] \"1\"  \"2a\" \"2b\"\n\n\nR seems to be happy to put them into a single vector. But there are different types of values and vectors, so lets ask R what each type of (using the “typeof” function) vectors we have above:\n\ntypeof(heights_vector)\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\ntypeof(names_vector)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\ntypeof(year_group)\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nThe numeric vector (“heights”) is a “double” vector. Double refers to the fact that the numbers can include decimals, as opposed to integer numbers which have to be whole numbers. Interestingly, R has assumed the list of numbers should be double rather than integer, which seems like the more robust thing to do, as integer numbers can always be double, but double numbers can’t always be integers. Strings are identified as “character” objects, because they are made of characters.\n\n\nData frames\nData frames look like tables, in which you have a series of columns with headers that describe each column.\nSome data frames are already loaded into RStudio when you run it, such as the “mpg” dataframe. To look at it, just type in it’s name (and press CTRL-ENTER on the line, or CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER within the chunk. Note that the below won’t work properly if you write it in the console, you should be running this within an rMarkdown or rNotebook):\n\n# To make a nice looking table in your html output from the \"mpg\" dataframe from the ggplot2 package:\nrmarkdown::paged_table(head(ggplot2::mpg))\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nNote that you may see 2 tables above, but they should be identical if so\nThe mpg dataframe has information about a variety of cars, their manufacturers, models, as described https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/mpg.html. You will need to refer to data frames and their columns, the convention for this being to write data frame$column. Lets do this to see what’s in the “manufacturer” column:\n\nggplot2::mpg$manufacturer\n\n  [1] \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"      \n  [6] \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"      \n [11] \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"      \n [16] \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"audi\"       \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\" \n [21] \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\" \n [26] \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\" \n [31] \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\" \n [36] \"chevrolet\"  \"chevrolet\"  \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [41] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [46] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [51] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [56] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [61] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [66] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"     \n [71] \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"dodge\"      \"ford\"      \n [76] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"      \n [81] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"      \n [86] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"      \n [91] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"      \n [96] \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"ford\"       \"honda\"     \n[101] \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"honda\"     \n[106] \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"honda\"      \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"   \n[111] \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"   \n[116] \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"   \n[121] \"hyundai\"    \"hyundai\"    \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"      \n[126] \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"       \"jeep\"      \n[131] \"land rover\" \"land rover\" \"land rover\" \"land rover\" \"lincoln\"   \n[136] \"lincoln\"    \"lincoln\"    \"mercury\"    \"mercury\"    \"mercury\"   \n[141] \"mercury\"    \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"    \n[146] \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"    \n[151] \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"nissan\"     \"pontiac\"   \n[156] \"pontiac\"    \"pontiac\"    \"pontiac\"    \"pontiac\"    \"subaru\"    \n[161] \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"    \n[166] \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"    \n[171] \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"subaru\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[176] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[181] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[186] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[191] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[196] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[201] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"    \n[206] \"toyota\"     \"toyota\"     \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[211] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[216] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[221] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[226] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n[231] \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\" \"volkswagen\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPackages\nWhilst a lot of the functions you will need are in the base code that is active by default, you will at times need extra packages of code to do more powerful things. A commonly used package is ggplot2 [https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/], which allows you to make beautiful figures in R. To use ggplot2 use need to install it and then load it from the library\n\nif(!require(ggplot2)){install.packages(\"ggplot2\")}\n\nLoading required package: ggplot2\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nNow that you have a package for making beautiful plots, lets learn about “intelligent copy and paste” to make use of it.\n\n\nIntelligent copy and paste\nPeople experienced with coding do not write all their code from memory. They often copy and paste code from the internet and/or from their old scripts. So, assuming you’ve installed and loaded ggplot2 as described above, lets copy and paste code from their website (as of September 2022; https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)\n\nggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nGood news is that we have a nice looking figure. But now we need to work out how to understand the code we’ve copied so that you can apply it to your own scripts. There’s a lot to unpack, so making the code more vertical can help you break it down and comment it out. Using the below and a description of the mpg dataframe (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/mpg.html), can you comment it out\n\nggplot(             # R will keep looking at your code until all the open brackets have been closed)\n  mpg,              #\n  aes(              #\n    displ,          #\n    hwy,            #\n    colour = class  #\n  )\n) +                 # R will look to the next line if you end a line with +\ngeom_point()        #\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how I would comment it out:\n\nggplot(\n  mpg,              # dataframe\n  aes(              # aesthetic properties\n    displ,          # x-axis\n    hwy,            # y-axis\n    colour = class  # which column I will base the color on (often \"color\" is safer spelling in code)\n  )\n) + \ngeom_point()        # what I would like drawn on (as opposed to boxplots, lines, etc.)\n\n\n\n\nFormatting code like above to be clearer to read is useful when sharing your scripts with other researchers so that they can understand it!\nNow to understand the above code, try running it after changing lines. For example, what happens if you change the x-axis:\n\nggplot(\n  mpg,              # dataframe\n  aes(              # aesthetic properties\n    cty,            # x-axis - updated\n    hwy,            # y-axis\n    colour = class  # which column I will base the color on (often \"color\" is safer spelling in code)\n  )\n) + \ngeom_point()        # what I would like drawn on (as opposed to boxplots, lines, etc.\n\n\n\n\nTo make beautiful figures in R, you can largely google the type of plot you want, copy the example code that the website has, and then swap in the relevant features for your plot. This principle of copying and pasting code, (making it vertical to make it legible is not necessary, but can be helpful), and then editing it to work for your own script is an essential skill to speed up your coding."

    "text": "type it directly into the console (generally not recommended)\nsave it as a script (better) note that script can refer to any of the below, but in this case is being used to describe a script that doesn’t generate a notebook\nsave it as an R Markdown (better still) - this allows you to make beautiful documents\nsave it as an R Notebook (arguably better than R Markdown) - this allows you to make beautiful documents, and is quicker\n\n\nThe Console\nAt the bottom left of RStudio you should have a console that looks something like what’s highlighted in red below:\n\n\n\nconsole\n\n\nYou can type straight into the console, to get a result. You can scroll through your previous commands by pressing the up arrow in the console. Each time code is run in the console it updates the environment in the top right of R-Studio:\n\n\n\nenvironment\n\n\n\n\nScripts\nThe word “script” can be interpreted specifically, to refer to a type of R file that includes a lot of code, or generally to refer to any file that includes both R code and code that allows you make a nice looking report. In this subsection, we will be focusing on “script” as a particular type of file. To create a script, click on File -> New File -> R Script\n\n\n\nnewScript\n\n\nYou will then be shown a blank script, in which you can write a series of functions, and then run them. To run the lines of code, select a line, and then press CTRL-ENTER, or highlight a chunk of code and then press CTRL-ENTER. In either case, the code will be sent to the console and run there.\nAn advantage of a script over just using the console is that you can analyse your data in both structured and complex ways which is difficult if you are typing code directly into the console.\n\n\nR Markdown\nAs highlighted above, R Markdown is a type of “script” in the general sense of the word, but allows you to create beautiful .html notebooks (.html files are what internet pages are based on). You are in fact reading an example of what can be produced by R Markdown (and R Notebooks). To make an R Markdown file, click on File -> New File -> R Markdown. You will be asked for a title, author and what output you would like. I would suggest “first markdown”, your name and “html” as the respective answers. You should then see something like:\n\n\n\nmarkdown\n\n\nThe following points apply to both R Markdown and R Notebooks\nIf you look above, you may notice that there are 2 types of code: Markdown (to write a nice looking report) and R (in grey chunks). I think these are well explained here: https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf so I’ll just explain that R Markdowns run all the code in the chunks each time they generate the output file (e.g. html file). This is important to know, because R Notebooks do not run all the code in all the chunks when you generate them (see below for more on this).\n\n\nR Notebooks\nR Notebooks can be created by clicking on File -> New File -> R Notebook. They look quite similar to R Markdowns, but automatically generate the .html output each time you save the notebook. The output file will be a .nb.html file in the same folder as your notebook.\nVery importantly - the .nb.html file will be built based on what happened the last time you run each R chunk. If you never ran the R Chunk, then the nb.html file will not use the output from that chunk. This makes R Notebooks quicker than R Markdowns, because you don’t have to generate the output from scratch each time, as it will just use whatever was generated the last time the chunk was run. However, this means that there’s a risk your .html output will not be what you expect if you failed to run all of your chunks before saving your file. To address this risk (when you’ve finished editing your file), you can select the “run all” option.\n\n\n\nrunAllChunks"

    "text": "In statistics, a variable is any (measurable) attribute that describes any organism or object. It’s called a variable because they vary from organism to organism or object to object. Height is a good example of a variable within humans, as height changes from person to person.\nWithin coding, a variable tends to refer to a particular object in your code, such as a specific value, list, dataset, etc. In R the terminology for a variable tends to be object.\nWhat is a hypothesis? A(n experimental) hypothesis is a possible outcome for the study you will run. Sometimes researchers think in terms of null hypotheses, which is what you would expect if your (experimental) hypothesis is incorrect."

We assume that a result is meaningful if there is only a very small chance that they could happen by accident.\nTechnical definition: The p-value is the probability of observing a particular (or more extreme) effect under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. To give a more concrete example: If the observed difference between two means is small, then there is a high probabilty that this difference could have occured if the null (there is no difference) is true, and so the resulting p-value would also be large. In contrast, if the difference is huge, then this is much less likely to have occured if the null is true, and the subsequent p-value will be smaller to reflect the lower probability."

Within psychology, the alpha value is .05, in which we believe that if the p-value is less than .05 then the result is “significant” (i.e. so unlikely that this would have happened by chance that we conclude this didn’t happen randomly).\nTechnical definition: The alpha-level is the expected rate of false-positives or type 1 errors (in the long run). Under the null hypothesis all p-values are equally probable, and so the value that alpha is sets the chance that a null hypothesis is rejected incorrectly (i.e. we say there is an effect when there isn’t one). Setting alpha at 0.05 is a convention that means we would only do this 5% of the time, and if we wanted to be more or less strict with the this false-positive rate, we could change the value."

Using the gapminder [https://www.gapminder.org/] dataset that is freely available about the world, we can look at the distribution of life expectancies across countries in 2007:\nSo whilst this histogram visualises the distribution of the data, it’s helpful to be able to statistically quantify (i.e. give numbers that represent) this distribution. Remember that for many statistical tests (parametric) it’s helpful to have data that is normally distributed. Normally distributed data (also known as Gaussian distributions and associated with parametric statistics) generally looks like a bell curve:\nSo we can see when comparing the shape of life expectancies and the shape of a normal distribution that the two aren’t the same.

The bigger the distance between these, the less normally distributed your data is. (see central tendancy below)\nSo now that we know what skewed distributions look like, we now need to quantify how much of a problem with skewness there is. If we add together the amount of skewness for each data point together and then divide by a general summary of the total standard deviation, then you get an estimate of skewness. The next section is a breakdown of the formula for those interested in it (but this is not crucial), but the key point point is that outliers skew the data, and so outliers that are larger than the mean positively skew the data, and outliers below the mean negatively skew it. If there are an equal number of outliers on either side of the mean then the data will not be skewed.\n\nOptional\nIf we want to manually calculate skewness:\n\\[\n\\tilde{\\mu_{3}} = \\sum((\\frac{x_i- \\bar{x}{}} {\\sigma} )^3) * \\frac{N}{(N-1) * (N-2)}\n\\] To do this in R you could calculate it manually\n\n# applying this to the positive skew data above\npositive_skew_n = length(positive_skew)\npositive_skewness = sum(((positive_skew - mean(positive_skew))/sd(positive_skew))^3) * (\n  positive_skew_n / ((positive_skew_n-1) * (positive_skew_n - 2))\n)\n# to show the output:\npositive_skewness\n\n[1] 0.56013\n\n\n… or just\n\nuse code from https://stackoverflow.com/a/54369572 to give you values for skewness (this has been chosen as this gives skewness and its standard error as calculated by major software like SPSS and JASP):\n\n# Skewness and kurtosis and their standard errors as implement by SPSS\n#\n# Reference: pp 451-452 of\n# http://support.spss.com/ProductsExt/SPSS/Documentation/Manuals/16.0/SPSS 16.0 Algorithms.pdf\n# \n# See also: Suggestion for Using Powerful and Informative Tests of Normality,\n# Ralph B.

To address this, lets use the skewness standard error (see above), to calculate a z-score. Z-scores can capture how significant a value is, i.e. how unlikely the number is considering what you would normally expect. In this case, when you divide skewness by standard error, you get a z-score, and if the absolute value (i.e. ignoring whether it is positive or negative) of the z-score is greater than 1.96 then it is significantly skewed. If you want to understand why 1.96 is the main number, check out the subsection on normal distributions.\nyou can calculate the standard error of skewness as below:\n\n# \n# sqrt((6*positive_skew_n*(positive_skew_n-1))/((positive_skew_n-2)*(positive_skew_n+1)*(positive_skew_n+3)))\n# \n# \n# \n# \n# positive_skew_n = length(positive_skew)\n# \n# \n# gini_n = length(gini_clean)\n# \n# gini_skewness = sum(((gini_clean - mean(gini_clean))/sd(gini_clean))^3) * (\n#   gini_n / ((gini_n-1) * (gini_n - 2))\n# )\n# \n# pos_skew_ses = sqrt((6*positive_skew_n*(positive_skew_n-1))/((positive_skew_n-2)*(positive_skew_n+1)*(positive_skew_n+3)))\n# \n# spssSkewKurtosis=function(x) {\n#   w=length(x)\n#   m1=mean(x)\n#   m2=sum((x-m1)^2)\n#   m3=sum((x-m1)^3)\n#   m4=sum((x-m1)^4)\n#   s1=sd(x)\n#   skew=w*m3/(w-1)/(w-2)/s1^3\n#   sdskew=sqrt( 6*w*(w-1) / ((w-2)*(w+1)*(w+3)) )\n#   kurtosis=(w*(w+1)*m4 - 3*m2^2*(w-1)) / ((w-1)*(w-2)*(w-3)*s1^4)\n#   sdkurtosis=sqrt( 4*(w^2-1) * sdskew^2 / ((w-3)*(w+5)) )\n#   mat=matrix(c(skew,kurtosis, sdskew,sdkurtosis), 2,\n#         dimnames=list(c(\"skew\",\"kurtosis\"), c(\"estimate\",\"se\")))\n#   return(mat)\n# }\n# \n# skewness(ineq_data$Gini)\n# kurtosis(ineq_data$Gini)\n# skewness(gini_clean)\n# describe(gini_clean)\n# gini_n = length(gini_clean)\n# sum((gini_clean - mean(gini_clean))^3)/\n#   (gini_n-1) * (gini_n-2) * sd(gini_clean)^3)\n# #sum(((gini_clean - mean(gini_clean))/sd(gini_clean))^3) * (1/length(gini_clean)\n\n:::\n\nkurtosis"
