#### Question 1
What association is there between the proportion of positive effects and FWER?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
viewof fwer_vs_fdr1_response = Inputs.radio(['Positive','Neutral','Negative']);
correct_fwer_vs_fdr1 = 'Neutral';
fwer_vs_fdr1_result = {
  if(fwer_vs_fdr1_response == correct_fwer_vs_fdr1){
    return 'Correct!';
  } else {
    return 'Incorrect or incomplete.';
  };
}
```
**${fwer_vs_fdr1_result}**

#### Question 2
What association is there between the proportion of positive effects and **FDR**?
```{ojs}
//| echo: false
viewof fwer_vs_fdr2_response = Inputs.radio(['Positive','Neutral','Negative']);
correct_fwer_vs_fdr2 = 'Negative';
fwer_vs_fdr2_result = {
  if(fwer_vs_fdr2_response == correct_fwer_vs_fdr2){
    return 'Correct! There should be a lower rate of false positives compared to false positives and true positives in a study that is investigating mostly positive effects compared to a study that is investigating mostly negative effects.';
  } else {
    return 'Incorrect or incomplete.';
  };
}
```
**${fwer_vs_fdr2_result}**
