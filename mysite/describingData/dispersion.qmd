To understand distribution below, it's helpful to clarify some more basic concepts around how data is **dispersed** around the mean. 

**Range** simply captures the min and the maximum values. Lets look at the min and max for the life expectancy data from 2007:

```{r}
# install (if required) and load the gapminder data
if(!require(gapminder)){install.packages("gapminder")}
library(gapminder)

# create a new data frame that only focuses on data from 2007
gapminder_2007 <- subset(
  gapminder,   # the data set
  year == 2007     
)

min(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)
max(gapminder_2007$lifeExp)
```
So the **range** for life expectancy in 2007 was between 39.613 and 82.603.


**Variance** is how much the data varies around a mean. The formula for variance of the sample is:
