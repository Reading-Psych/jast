## Simple Regression

Simple regression also known as linear regression builds on correlation, except unlike correlation (which quantifies the strength of the linear relationship between a pair of variables), regression allows you to make **predictions** on how **one variable** affects **another**.

For example, if your looking to see how 'x' influences 'y' then regression will help predict or explain a numeric response.

The main objective of regression analysis is to estimate the values of a random variable (z) based on the values of your known (or fixed) variables (x and y).

Linear regression analysis operates by drawing the **best fitting line** through the data points. But this [does not]{.underline} imply causation, as regression only models the data. Regression can't tell us exactly what is influencing what (i.e. whether hours of sleep affect depression score or if depression score affects hours of sleep), its not a perfect representation but its good enough!

If we want to see whether sleep (independent variable in this case) affects depression (dependent variable) then we need to know this equation...

For this equation we will always retrieve values from the graph, except residuals, which is the 'error'

```{r regression graph}


1 + 1
```

#### **Why use regression?**

Regression builds on correlation by providing a more detailed view of your data and with this provides an equation that can be used for any future predicting and optimizing of your data.

```{r differences between regression and correlation}
#| echo: false

#compute table of regression and correlation#
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
