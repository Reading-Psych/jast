  <h3>What is a hypothesis?</h3>
  <p>
    A(n <b>experimental) hypothesis</b> is a possible outcome for the study you will run. Sometimes researchers think in terms of <b>null hypotheses</b>, which is what you would expect if your (experimental) hypothesis is incorrect. 
  </p>
  <h3>What is a p-value? </h3>
  <p>
    <b>Oversimplification:</b> A p-value tells you how likely your hypothesis is correct <br>
    <b>Better definition:</b> How likely you would get your current results by chance (i.e. randomly). We assume that a result is meaningful if there is only a very small chance that they could happen by accident. This can also be thought of the likelihood of the null hypotheses being correct based on the current data.
