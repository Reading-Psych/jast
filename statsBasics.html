  <h3>What is a variable?</h3>
  <p>
    In <b>statistics</b>, a <b>variable</b> is any (measurable) attribute that describes any organism or object. It's called a variable because they <b>vary</b> from organism to organism or object to object. Height is a good example of a variable within humans, as height changes from person to person.

  <p>
    Within <b>coding</b>, a <b>variable</b> tends to refer to a particular <b>object</b> in your code, such as a specific value, list, dataset, etc. In R the terminology for a variable tends to be <b>object</b>.
  </p>
  <h3>What is a hypothesis?</h3>
  <p>
    A(n <b>experimental) hypothesis</b> is a possible outcome for the study you will run. Sometimes researchers think in terms of <b>null hypotheses</b>, which is what you would expect if your (experimental) hypothesis is incorrect. 
  </p>
  <h3>What is a p-value? </h3>
  <p>
    <b>Oversimplification:</b> A p-value tells you how likely your hypothesis is correct <br>
    <b>Better definition:</b> How likely you would get your current results by chance (i.e. randomly). We assume that a result is meaningful if there is only a very small chance that they could happen by accident. This can also be thought of the likelihood of the null hypotheses being correct based on the current data.
