**e values** can be used to indicate a number that is multiplied by 10^e or 0.1^e. For example, 3.1e3 is the same as 3.1 * 10^3 (which is the same as 3100):

```{r}
3.1e3 - 3.1 * 10^3
```

If e has a minus after it, then you multiply by the number by 0.1^e. For example, 2.5e-3 is the same as 2.5 * 0.1^3 (which is the same as .0025):

```{r}
2.5e-3 - 2.5 * 0.1^3
```

(which is effectively 0, R has oddities around generating extremely small numbers rather than 0s sometimes)
