## What is a variable?
In **statistics**, a **variable** is any (measurable) attribute that describes any organism or object. It's called a variable because they **vary** from organism to organism or object to object. Height is a good example of a variable within humans, as height changes from person to person.
 
 
Within **coding**, a **variable** tends to refer to a particular **object** in your code, such as a specific value, list, dataset, etc. In R the terminology for a variable tends to be **object**.
  
**What is a hypothesis?**
A(n **experimental) hypothesis** is a possible outcome for the study you will run. Sometimes researchers think in terms of **null hypotheses**, which is what you would expect if your (experimental) hypothesis is incorrect. 


## What is a p-value?

**Oversimplification:** A p-value tells you how likely your hypothesis is correct

**Better definition:** How likely you would get your current results by chance (i.e. randomly). We assume that a result is meaningful if there is only a very small chance that they could happen by accident.

**Technical definition** The p-value is the probability of observing a particular (or more extreme) effect under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.
To give a more concrete example: If the observed difference between two means is small, then there is a high probabilty that this difference could have occured if the null (there is no difference) is true, and so the resulting p-value would also be large. In contrast, if the difference is huge, then this is much less likely to have occured if the null is true, and the subsequent p-value will be smaller to reflect the lower probability.  


## What is the alpha value?
It is the p-value threshold that identifies if a result is "significant" or not. Within psychology, the alpha value is .05, in which we believe that if the p-value is less than .05 then the result is "significant" (i.e. so unlikely that this would have happened by chance that we conclude this didn't happen randomly).
