    <!--
    <a href="https://jasp-stats.org" target="_blank">JASP (open-source)</a> <br>
    <a href="https://www.python.org">Python (open-source)</a><br>
    -->
    <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.r-project.org">R (open-source)</a></li><br>

    This "textbook" is all on a single page so that you can search the page for a key term. Ctrl-F (on windows machines) should help you find any nugget of wisdom on the page you previously read.
